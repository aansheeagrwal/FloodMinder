**FloodMinder** is a web application that uses Machine Learning to predict floods based on weather data and historical disaster records. It aims to provide real-time insights and visualizations to help communities prepare and respond effectively.

---

## **üåê Live Demo**
Currently under deployment. Link will be updated soon.

---

## **Features**

### 1. Flood Prediction
- Predict potential floods based on weather and historical data.
- Real-time predictions using ML models.
- Visual display of flood probability.

### 2. Earthquake Prediction
- Input seismic parameters to get earthquake likelihood.
- Instant results with probability scoring.

### 3. Hurricane Prediction
- Predict hurricane occurrence based on wind, pressure, and sea surface temperature.
- Shows prediction along with impact indicators.

### 4. Interactive Visualizations
- Bubble plots for flood probability, rainfall, and damage predictions.
- Heatmaps to analyze regions with high flood risk.
- Satellite imagery for precipitation patterns over time.

### 5. User-friendly Interface
- Simple forms to input environmental parameters.
- Results shown instantly in an easy-to-read format.
- Designed using Flask with responsive HTML templates.

### üí° Inspiration
Floods are frequent and devastating. In India alone, over 80% of the population (~1.08B) is at risk, causing billions of USD in economic losses annually. FloodMinder predicts floods in advance and visualizes potential impact effectively.

---
### üõ† How We Built It
- Dataset: Scraped historical flood data + Visual Crossing weather API.

- ML Models: Random Forest, Logistic Regression, KNN tested; Random Forest chosen.

- Data Visualization: Scatter plots, heatmaps, bubble plots (Plotly), satellite images (matplotlib + cartopy).

- Front-End: Flask templates with HTML, CSS & JS integration.

---
### ‚ö° Challenges
- Limited historical flood data

- Integrating interactive plots with Flask

- Managing dataset & pickle file inconsistencies
---
### üèÜ Accomplishments
- High-performing flood prediction model

- Interactive visualizations for flood impact & risk

- Learned web scraping, data preprocessing, and Plotly integration
---
### üîÆ Next Steps
- Expand coverage to cities worldwide.

- Develop an image classification model for flood detection from satellite imagery.

- Make predictions and visualizations more accessible for governments and citizens to enhance disaster preparedness.
